# Final-Project

For my final project I plan on creating an interactive site for my photography portfolio. I think that photography is something that can be more interactive on the web than simply scrolling through a carousel of photos. I am interested in exploring the movement of photos on the screen and creating an interactive way of exploring my work whether that be in movement, color, or atmosphere. 

For one drawing I plan on taking a collection photographs that fall into different categories such as portrait, landscape, or street photography have them all mixed together in rows which move in different directions. You can then isolate the different genres by clicking on buttons and drowning out all the other photos as they float across the screen.

Another drawing I had in mind is an atmospheric page in which either the color scheme of the page or the sound will change according to the atmosphere of the photo which the user chooses. When the user selects a photo the entire feel of the page will change.

The last drawing, I plan on doing is an interactive portrait gallery in which the page displays a few portraits in html canvas and letting the viewer run through different color options or pixilationâ€™s of the photos.
